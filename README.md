### Viewport Rename

A simple Blender Add-on to rename selected objects in *3d View*.

Once the Add-on is enabled, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>R</kbd> to enter a 'new name' for the *active object*. In order to speed up the process you can hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd> to confirm afterwards.

The Add-on also allows to *batch rename* all objects in the current selection. The suffix is determined by the given number of hash characters at the end of the string. You can simply type `Cube-###` to get *'Cube-001'*, *'Cube-002'* and *'Cube-003'* as well as `Cube-###r` to get a reversed list.
